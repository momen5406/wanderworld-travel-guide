# 🌍 WanderWorld – Explore Cities Around the Globe

WanderWorld is a travel guide web app I built to strengthen my skills in working with **real-world APIs** and **object-oriented programming in JavaScript**. It allows users to search for any country and instantly view:

* ✅ A brief description (via Wikipedia API)
* 📸 Real images from Unsplash
* ☁️ 3-day weather forecast using WeatherAPI
* 🌐 Key country info (flag, capital, region, languages, currency, timezone, etc.)

I built this project using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and vanilla JavaScript. All the APIs are fetched dynamically, and I’ve focused on a smooth and responsive UI/UX.
